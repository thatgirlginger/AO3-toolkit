# AO3-Scraper-Tools
a python set for scraping and getting AO3 fanfiction data for given parameters compatible with Python3

this particular AO3 scraping repository is made customizable to what you want to do with your project. i've included a couple of sample scripts, just to show how i use these, but you could definitely use it as an API

please be mindful of AO3's requests regarding web scraping. set user headers to "bot", implement a generous request timing, and don't scrape on weekends (I can't find a public version of that last one, but I was recommended by an OTW volunteer staffer when I reached out regarding recommendations to ensure that I avoided overloading the site and respected users' wishes for their content)

i'm on tumblr as secretly-historic; i'd love to see any cool things made with this package!
