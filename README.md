# AO3-Scraper-Tools
A python set for scraping and getting AO3 fanfiction data for given parameters compatible with Python3

This particular AO3 scraping repository is made customizable to what you want to do with your project. I've included a few sample scripts for the ways that I typically use these

Please be mindful of AO3's requests regarding web scraping: set user headers to "bot", implementing a generous request timing, and not scraping on weekends (I can't find a public version of that last one, but I was recommended by an OTW volunteer staffer when I reached out regarding recommendations to ensure that I avoided overloading the site and respected users' wishes for their content)

because there is major concern in the ao3 community regarding scraping for AI training and generation purposes, this code does NOT include the ability to retrieve individual work, textual content, user, or comment data. if you are seeing this, it's because i have granted you access to this repo and have asked about your use purposes. please do not modify this code in any way, shape, or form to do so

that being said, i'd love to hear what you've done with this if you end up using it for a project! i'm on tumblr as secretly-historic and have posted some about fanfic-related topics in the past :-)
