# AO3-Scraper-Tools
a python set for scraping and getting AO3 fanfiction data for given parameters compatible with Python3

this particular AO3 scraping repository is made customizable to what you want to do with your project. i've included a couple of sample scripts, just to show how i use these, but you could definitely use it as an API

please be mindful of AO3's requests regarding web scraping. set user headers to "bot", implement a generous request timing, and don't scrape on weekends (I can't find a public version of that last one, but I was recommended by an OTW volunteer staffer when I reached out regarding recommendations to ensure that I avoided overloading the site and respected users' wishes for their content)

out of respect for the ao3 user community concerns regarding AI scraping and training, this code does NOT include the ability to retrieve individual work identification, textual content, user, or comment data. (if you are seeing this right now, it's likely because i have granted you access to this repo and have asked about your use purposes. please do not modify this code in any way, shape, or form). users' works are protected by copyright (per the OTW) and cannot be reproduced in any way for commercial purposes. in addition to that, commercializing any part of reproduced works puts the entire fanfiction community at risk. in short, don't be an ass.

the copyright license for this work strictly prohibits the code's use for AI training purposes

that being said, i'd love to hear what you've done with this if you end up using it for a project! i'm on tumblr as secretly-historic and have posted some about fanfic-related topics in the past :-)
